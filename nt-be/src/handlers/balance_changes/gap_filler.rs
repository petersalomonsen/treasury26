//! Gap Filler Service
//!
//! This module implements the core gap filling logic using RPC-based binary search.
//! It orchestrates the detection and filling of gaps in balance change chains.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! When a gap is detected (balance_after of record N doesn't match balance_before of record N+1),
//! this service:
//! 1. Uses binary search to find the exact block where the balance changed
//! 2. Queries the balance before and after at that block
//! 3. Gets the block timestamp
//! 4. Inserts a new balance_change record to fill the gap
//!
//! This approach uses only RPC queries and doesn't require external APIs.

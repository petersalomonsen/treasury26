# Balance Change Collection - Implementation Phases

This document breaks down the implementation into small, reviewable phases. Each phase builds on the previous one and can be tested independently.

## Test-Driven Development Approach

**Every phase follows TDD:**
1. Write integration test first (can fail initially)
2. Write unit tests for the component
3. Implement the minimum code to pass tests
4. Refactor while keeping tests green

Integration tests are written early and updated as new functionality is added. They serve as living documentation and ensure components work together correctly.

---

## Phase 1: Integration Test Infrastructure

**Goal:** Set up integration test framework and first test case.

**New file:** `tests/balance_collection_integration_test.rs`

**Initial test:**
```rust
#[sqlx::test]
async fn test_detect_gaps_in_balance_chain(pool: PgPool) -> sqlx::Result<()> {
    // Insert records with gaps
    // Call gap detection (will fail initially)
    // Assert gaps are correctly identified
    Ok(())
}
```

**Review criteria:**
- Test database setup works
- Can run with `cargo test --test balance_collection_integration_test`
- Clear test structure and assertions
- Uses sqlx test fixtures

---

## Phase 2: Database Schema Update

---

## Phase 2: Database Schema Update

**Goal:** Rename `raw_data` to `receipt` to better reflect its purpose.

**Files to modify:**
- `migrations/20251223000001_create_balance_changes.sql`

**TDD approach:**
1. Update integration test to use `receipt` field
2. Run migration
3. Verify test passes

**Review criteria:**
- Migration runs successfully
- Column renamed with no data loss
- Integration test passes

---

## Phase 3: Core Data Structures

**Goal:** Define Rust types for balance changes and gaps.

**New module:** `src/models/balance_change.rs`

**TDD approach:**
1. Add integration test that queries and inserts using new structs
2. Define structs
3. Implement sqlx traits (FromRow, etc.)
4. Test passes

**Define:**
```rust
pub struct BalanceChange {
    pub account_id: String,
    pub token_id: String,
    pub block_height: i64,
    pub block_timestamp: i64,
    pub balance_before: String,
    pub balance_after: String,
    pub counterparty: Option<String>,
    pub actions: serde_json::Value,
    pub receipt: serde_json::Value,
}

pub struct BalanceGap {
    pub account_id: String,
    pub token_id: String,
    pub start_block: i64,
    pub end_block: i64,
    pub expected_balance_before: String,
    pub actual_balance_after: String,
}
```

**Review criteria:**
- Types are well-documented
- Clear separation of concerns
- Integration test demonstrates usage

---

## Phase 4: Gap Detection Algorithm

**Goal:** Implement logic to scan existing records and find gaps.

**New module:** `src/services/gap_detector.rs`

**TDD approach:**
1. Write integration test with known gap scenarios
2. Write unit tests for edge cases (no records, single record, no gaps)
3. Implement gap detection
4. All tests pass

**Function:**
```rust
pub async fn find_gaps(
    pool: &PgPool,
    account_id: &str,
    token_id: &str,
    start_block: i64,
) -> Result<Vec<BalanceGap>>
```

**Implementation approach - SQL Window Functions:**

Use PostgreSQL's LAG window function to compare `balance_after` of each record with `balance_before` of the next:

```sql
WITH balance_chain AS (
    SELECT 
        account_id,
        token_id,
        block_height,
        balance_before,
        balance_after,
        LAG(block_height) OVER w as prev_block_height,
        LAG(balance_after) OVER w as prev_balance_after
    FROM balance_changes
    WHERE account_id = $1 
      AND token_id = $2
      AND block_height <= $3
    WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY account_id, token_id ORDER BY block_height)
)
SELECT 
    account_id,
    token_id,
    prev_block_height as start_block,
    block_height as end_block,
    prev_balance_after::TEXT as actual_balance_after,
    balance_before::TEXT as expected_balance_before
FROM balance_chain
WHERE prev_block_height IS NOT NULL 
  AND balance_before != prev_balance_after;
```

**Benefits:**
- Single efficient query with O(n) complexity
- Database handles sorting and comparison
- No need to load all data into memory
- Leverages PostgreSQL's optimized window functions

**Integration test scenarios:**
- No existing records → no gaps
- Connected chain → no gaps  
- Gap in middle → detected
- Multiple gaps → all detected
- Gap at start (no previous record) → handled correctly

**Review criteria:**
- Clear, readable function logic
- Well-commented SQL queries
- All tests pass
- Handles edge cases (no previous record means starting point, not a gap)

pub async fn get_balance_change_at_block(
    account_id: &str,
    token_id: &str,
    block_height: i64,
) -> Result<(String, String)> // (before, after)
```

**Integration test:**

        "NEAR",
        123456789,

- Command-line argument parsing
- Progress output
- Integration test validates CLI execution

---

## Implementation Order Notes

- **TDD is mandatory:** Write tests before implementation in every phase
- Each phase should be a separate PR for easy review
- Integration tests start in Phase 1 and grow with each phase
- Keep functions small (ideally < 50 lines, max 80 lines)
- Use helper functions to break up complex logic
- Add inline comments explaining "why", not "what"
- Each module should have module-level documentation
- Mark tests requiring external services with `#[ignore]` but run them during development

## Quick Start Recommendation

**Phases 1-4 can be implemented immediately** using existing test data:

The `test-webassemblymusic-treasury.json` file contains complete balance chain data with:
- Continuous balance_before/balance_after sequences
- Multiple token types (NEAR, FT, Intents)
- Real transaction data

**Important:** Do NOT rely on the `verificationWithNext` field in the test data. It's derived data that could be incorrect. Instead, implement proper gap detection that compares consecutive records' balances.

**Approach:**
1. Use existing `balance_changes_test.rs` as the integration test base
2. Load test data into database (already working)
3. Delete specific records to create artificial gaps
4. Implement gap detection with SQL window functions
5. Verify detected gaps match what was deleted
6. Validate that connected chains show zero gaps

**Gap detection validates:**
- `balance_after` of record[i] equals `balance_before` of record[i+1]
- For same account_id and token_id
- Ordered by block_height

This provides immediate validation of the core gap-detection algorithm without needing external APIs or RPC calls.
